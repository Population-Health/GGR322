      <h2>Course overview</h2>
      <p>
The purpose of this course will be to develop an appreciation for the conceptual and methodological intersections that exist between geographical information systems and population health. 
        While population health can include incidence and prevalence of disease and ill-health, as well as concerns about service provision, this course will focus mainly on disease, injury, 
        illness more broadly. The course will include both lectures, where foundational concepts will be introduced and related to practical lab sessions, where students will gain experience 
        using GIS to map and study health information. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In this course, Students learn how to work with census and health datasets, handle a GIS project, apply spatial clustering approaches, build spatial accessibility measures,
        and produce maps that support public health practice and policy.
