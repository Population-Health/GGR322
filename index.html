      <h2>Course overview</h2>
      <p>
The purpose of this course will be to develop an appreciation for the conceptual and methodological intersections that exist between geographical information systems and population health. 
        While population health can include incidence and prevalence of disease and ill-health, as well as concerns about service provision, this course will focus mainly on disease, injury, 
        illness more broadly. The course will include both lectures, where foundational concepts will be introduced and related to practical lab sessions, where students will gain experience 
        using GIS to map and study health information. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In this course, Students learn how to work with census and health datasets, handle a GIS project, apply spatial clustering approaches, build spatial accessibility measures,
        and produce maps that support public health practice and policy.

      <h2> Student Mini-project portfolio (Fall 2025)</h2>
      <p>
        The mini project focuses on walkability as a neighbourhood feature that can shape daily mobility, access to amenities, community interaction, and health outcomes. Walkability resources are not distributed 
        evenly across neighbourhoods, and this uneven distribution can affect population groups that face health risks or social inequities. Students were placed in the role of GIS analysts working within a geospatial 
        data science team tasked with supporting a new funding initiative aimed at improving walkability for populations of concern. Each student was assigned a Census Division and identified a priority population 
        based on vulnerability or equity considerations. Using spatial methods, students mapped where this population clusters and analysed where walkability resources are limited or insufficient. Lastly, students 
        overlayed both outcomes to highlight neighbourhoods that should receive interventions that would improve walkability infrastructure.
